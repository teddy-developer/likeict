      Node.js follows a single-threaded, event-driven architecture, which means
      it can handle multiple requests simultaneously without blocking the
      execution of other operations. This non-blocking I/O model allows Node.js
      to efficiently handle I/O-intensive tasks, such as file operations or
      network requests. Node.js is particularly well-suited for building
      scalable applications that require high concurrency and real-time
      communication.
